## Artificial Intelligence in Education

> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.

## Agentic AI, Multiagent Systems and Intelligent Autonomous Agents

> Solving complex problems in multiple situations requires the use of distributed components endowed with intelligence, called agents, which in turn interact with a common environment to achieve common or conflicting goals, giving rise to multi-agent systems. These systems, whose origins date back to the 1970s, break down complex problems into smaller, more specific parts that perform specific tasks autonomously and intelligently. In recent years, the advent of language models (LLMs) has transformed classical multi-agent systems into what is known as Agentic AI, where agents become more sophisticated, autonomous, and strategic in their decision-making thanks to this type of model.
> In this line, we are currently working on projects to implement digital twins of crime, mobility and sustainability in the urban environment, combining Agentic AI with other lines of AI such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep learning techniques, or data extraction and fusion.
