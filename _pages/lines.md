## Agentic AI, Multiagent Systems and Intelligent Autonomous Agents

> Solving complex problems in multiple situations requires the use of distributed components endowed with intelligence, called agents, which in turn interact with a common environment to achieve common or conflicting goals, giving rise to multi-agent systems. These systems, whose origins date back to the 1970s, break down complex problems into smaller, more specific parts that perform specific tasks autonomously and intelligently. In recent years, the advent of language models (LLMs) has transformed classical multi-agent systems into what is known as Agentic AI, where agents become more sophisticated, autonomous, and strategic in their decision-making thanks to this type of model.

> Our group has been involved in research on multi-agent systems since the 1990s. In this line, we are currently working on projects to implement digital twins of crime, mobility and sustainability in the urban environment, combining Agentic AI with other lines of AI such as multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep learning techniques, or data extraction and fusion.
