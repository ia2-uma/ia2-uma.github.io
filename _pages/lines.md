## Data Mining and Machine Learning
> One of the main approaches to extract information from large and complex datasets using artificial intelligence is the application of data mining processes and machine learning methods. Traditional analytical tools often fail to uncover underlying patterns, relationships and coherences. Data mining refers to the systematic process of discovering meaningful structures, trends, and correlations within large volumes of data. Within this process, machine learning plays a central role by providing algorithms capable of learning from data, identifying patterns, and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Together, these techniques enable intelligent analysis that adapts and improves over time as new data becomes available.

> The team has been actively involved in these fields since before the year 2000. In addition to applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques—such as ensemble methods, online learning, decision trees, or Markov models—we also develop our own algorithms tailored to specific challenges. These approaches are combined with efficient data mining processes and applied to real-world problems across a variety of domains. Current applications include urban sustainability, nature-based solutions, renewable energy systems, and the detection of suicidal behavior, among others. All of these initiatives are supported by a robust data infrastructure and advanced engineering methodologies that enable the effective extraction, transformation, and integration of data from heterogeneous sources.

## Agentic AI, Multiagent Systems and Intelligent Autonomous Agents

> In the field of Artificial Intelligence, one of the strategies for solving complex problems is based on the use of distributed components endowed with intelligence, called agents, which in turn interact with a common environment to achieve common or conflicting objectives, giving rise to multi-agent systems. These systems, whose origins date back to the 1970s, decompose complex problems into smaller, more specific parts that perform specific tasks autonomously and intelligently. In recent years, the advent of language modeling (LLM) has transformed classical multi-agent systems into what is known as **Agentic AI**, where agents become more sophisticated, autonomous and strategic in their decision making thanks to this type of models.

> Our group has been involved in research on multi-agent systems since the 1990s. In this line, we are currently working on projects to implement digital twins for crime, mobility and sustainability in the urban environment, combining Agentic AI with other lines of AI such as multi-agent reinforcement learning or deep learning models, and with data engineering techniques for intelligent data extraction and fusion.
